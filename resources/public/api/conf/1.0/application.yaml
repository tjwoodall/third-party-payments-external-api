  title: Initiate payment
  description: |
    This API allows users to trigger an HMRC payment journey from their software. 
    
    The workflow enables an API user to redirect a customer through to an HMRC payment journey. 
    If an optional back-url was provided by the API user we will offer this as a link to the customer to continue their journey.
    
    Additional details about the outcome of the payment can be discovered 
    by the API user by taking advantage of the /status endpoint.

    Typical lifetimes for journey storage are not yet determined.

          The request body always contains the fields that allow HMRC to identify the liability that is being paid, so 
          that the funds are not mis-allocated. The required fields are the taxRegime, the reference and amountInPence.
          The backURL is an optional field containing a url to return the user to after they finish their payment.
          The friendlyName is an optional field to let the user know where they are being returned to after they finish their payment.
          If a field is labeled as optional, we intend this to mean that it should be *omitted entirely* - not sent through with a null value etc.

        The API user can check the payment status by providing the clientJourneyId used

        The JSON body returned will include the clientJourneyId, the taxRegime, the amountInPence paid and also the paymentStatus.

        ### Test data
        Scenario simulation using Gov-Test-Scenario headers is *only available in the sandbox environment*.
        You will not be able to access the frontend screens to complete the journey, but you can use headers in the POST request 
        to set a journey into a certain state. To achieve this send a Gov-Test-Scenario header with a value matching one of the values below. 

        | Header Value (Gov-Test-Scenario) | Scenario description                                        |
        | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
        | COMPLETED                        | The payment has completed and the transfer is made.         |
        | FAILED                           | The payment has failed for one of the following reasons: <br> - The payment was cancelled by the user or timed out at the bank during the payment process. <br> - The bank or building society has rejected the payment. <br> - The payment has failed due to an error. |
        | IN_PROGRESS                      | The payment is in progress but has not completed or failed. |
